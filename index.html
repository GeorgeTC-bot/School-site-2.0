        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <a>My Experience of this school was Great. Specially the Teacher.They were the greatest. Like the cherry on a cake.But for some reason, the washrooms smell weird... as if someone kept a fish there. There is an </a>
        <a>out of comission toilet which no one has opened and rumors have it that it is comming from there. But any who had dared to open and see it's content have never come back alive... Aside from that, a really </a>
        <a>great school!! Just don't look into the out of commissioned toilet that much...</a>
